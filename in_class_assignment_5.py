#Problem 1. Sort With Quicksort.
# Please build a function called "quicksort" that uses recursion to define the quicksort algorithm for a list of any length. 
# Build a main script that reads in the list provided, "numbers.txt", and runs it through your quicksort algorithm. 
# The main script should return the finished sorted list as "sorted.txt"
# All 3 files "In_class_assignment_5.py", "numbers.txt", and "sorted.txt" should all be added to your github repository and submitted as a github link.

def quicksort(numbers_in_a_list):

#WRITE YOUR CODE HERE FOR THE RECURSIVE SORTING FUNCTION

    return #WHAT DOES IT RETURN?


def main():

# WRITE YOUR MAIN FUNCTION HERE TO READ IN YOUR numbers.txt FILE, RUN THE LIST THROUGH YOUR SORTING ALGORITHM, 
# AND WRITE OUT YOUR FILE

    return #WHAT DOES IT RETURN?
